# QXelerator Installation

QXelerator or QBeeSim is the python interface to QBeeSim simulator, which is perhaps the most easiest way to start simulating quantum circuits. Python binary wheels are available which can be used to setup QXelerator by following the instructions in [README.md](qxelarator/README.md) available in the qxelerator directory.


# Required Packages

The following packges are required if you are not using pre-built conda packages:

* g++ compiler with C++11 support (Linux)
* MSVC 2015 with update 3 or above (Windows)
* cmake (>= 3.0)
* swig
* python (>= 3.5) [for python interface to QX]


# Installation

To build run the following in the current directory:
```sh
mkdir build && cd build && cmake ../ && make
```

This creates a bin folder containing subfolders:
-  /bin/qx-server
-  /bin/qx-simulator

Each containing its respective executable

To install you can further run:
```sh
make install
```

which installs the two executables under the default bin directory, usually:
  /usr/local/bin

To change this, cmake can be ran with the following prefix:

```sh
cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=<desired_absolute_path>
```
